Week Six Assignment

This lab has you build the framework of the game. Starting with a blank python file add the following items:


•A header comment with your name and the class name
• A function definition for the following functions: ◦populate(world,h,w)
◦ display(world,h,w)
◦ generation(world,h,w)

•A main() function that does the following: 
◦imports random
◦ defines the initial variables for the world, the height and width (to start use height = 80, width = 22)
◦ runs the populate function
◦ runs the display function
◦prompts the user to enter any key
◦Loops while the entered key !='q' ◾run the generation function, replacing the current world with the newly generated world
◾display the new world
◾ prompts the user to enter a key



You do not need to put any code into the function definitions at this point. However, you DO need to add a comment before each definition that states what the function does, what parameters it takes, and what (if anything) the function will return.  Right now, only the generation function returns a value, namely a new list that contains your updated world.

 You MAY have to put some 'dummy code' into the functions to show that they are being called. Also, you WILL have to create a new list variable inside the generation function and return that variable.

 IF you build this correctly the program SHOULD RUN.  (even though it won't necessarily DO anything!)
